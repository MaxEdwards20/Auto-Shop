In order to run the Django Prototype, 
change into the outer autoshop  directory, if you havenâ€™t already, 
and run the following commands:


$ python manage.py runserver

Once you have confirmed that the server is running, use the url in a browser to serve the 
site locally. Use the url http://localhost:8000/polls/
